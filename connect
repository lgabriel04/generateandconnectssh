Here are the steps to generate and connect an SSH key to your GitHub account:

Open Git Bash on your computer.

Generate a new SSH key by typing the following command and pressing enter:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Note: Replace "your_email@example.com" with the email address associated with your GitHub account.

Press enter to accept the default location to save the key.

Enter a passphrase for your key when prompted or leave it blank for no passphrase.

Add the SSH key to your ssh-agent by typing the following command and pressing enter:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

Add the key to the ssh-agent by typing the following command and pressing enter:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Copy the contents of the public key to your clipboard by typing the following command and pressing enter:

clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Note: If you're using macOS or Linux, use the following command instead: pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Log in to your GitHub account in your web browser.

Click on your profile icon and select "Settings" from the drop-down menu.

Click on "SSH and GPG keys" from the menu on the left.

Click on the "New SSH key" button.

Give your key a name in the "Title" field.

Paste the copied key into the "Key" field.

Click the "Add SSH key" button.

Verify that the key was added successfully by typing the following command and pressing enter:

ssh -T git@github.com

If successful, you should see a message that says "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."
